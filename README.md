heres how to setup lightlink

# Step 1

```
pnpm install
```

install modules

# Step 2

create and edit a .env file in the root directory with these properties

ADMIN_PASSCODE:{passcode here}

DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL:{url here} (optional)

# Step 3

```
pnpm start
```

run the server

# Step 4

visit http://localhost:1100

not the right port? change it in the **src/index.js** directory

# Step 5 (optional)

when first ran, and the .env has the vapid keys and stuff, change the vapid email, or go into profiles/server.js and change it there before first run

# .env Check

your .env file should in the end look like this

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD={password here}
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL={url here} (optional)
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY={key here} (auto generated)
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY={key here} (auto generated)
VAPID_EMAIL={email here} (auto generated)
```

if you do not have the admin password, the admin features WILL be disabled (and might be hackable idk) so make sure to set the ADMIN_PASSWORD in the .env file

# Tip

admin panel will be at localhost:(port)/profiles/admin.html

# Notice

the database in profiles, the .env, and the node_modules do not save by default. to change this in your own github repo, change the .gitignore to not allow these items (database and .env is not reccomended to be shown publicly as it may store user info, admin controls, and discord webhooks if configured.)

any errors report to **.yzycoin.** on discord or go to https://github.com/lightight/lightlink/issues
